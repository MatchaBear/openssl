4. openssl genrsa -out private-key.key 2048
found the generated key in here: C:\Users\bernh\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\OpenSSL-Win32\bin
private-key.key
open the key file with notepad++

5. PS C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSSL-Win32\bin> openssl req -new -key private-key.key -out csr.txt

openssl req -new \-newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key \-out yourdomain.csr \-subj "/C=SG/ST=Singapore/L=Dimanaajalah/O=Apalah, Inc./OU=IT/CN=apalah.com.sg"
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr -subj "/C=SG/ST=Singapore/L=Dimanaajalah/O=Apalah, Inc./OU=IT/CN=apalah.com.sg"
